# Empty entries mean we've checked and these providers don't need curation.
# Semantics are the same as if the entry was missing.

# Properties:
#   - "exclusions": ignore these resources
#   - "explicit": (boolean) if true, don't use a tracking version, only explicit versions for each resource
#   - "preferPreview": use the latest -preview version rather than latest stable
#   - "folders": folder(s) of the Azure spec GH repo containing this RP, purely informational
#   - "notes": misc. information for future readers
