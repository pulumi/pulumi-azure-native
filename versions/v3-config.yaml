  AzureSpecVersion: 55dd4f72d2b2769c1e02f2b952e597f806d40f9a

# Empty entries mean we've checked and these providers don't need curation.
# Semantics are the same as if the entry was missing.

# Properties:
#   - "exclusions": ignore these resources. The value can be a specific API version, in which case _all_ versions
#     between the default version and the given version (including) will be ignored. The value can also be "*" to
#     ignore that resource altogether.
#   - "explicit": (boolean) if true, don't use a tracking version, only explicit versions for each resource
#   - "preview": (prefer|exclude) use the latest -preview version rather than latest stable
#   - "folders": folder(s) of the Azure spec GH repo containing this RP, purely informational
#   - "notes": misc. information for future readers
#  - "expectTracking": Either "stable" or "preview" - defaults to "stable"

# Auditing notes:
# - Compare v1-config with v2-config and look for significant changes
# - If no version listed, why?
# - Has it gone from stable to preview?
# - Does it have old additions? Could they be excluded if moved elsewhere?
# - If it was previously explicit, does it still need to be?

    The TestApi integration test fails when using 2024-05-01 so we currently need to use a lower version.
    The documentation is for 2024-05-01: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/apimanagement/api-version-set
    The portal uses 2022-09-01-preview, so we'll go with that as it includes most new resources.
