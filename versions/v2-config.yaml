META: # not great to be in same namespace than the RPs
  AzureSpecVersion: 55dd4f72d2b2769c1e02f2b952e597f806d40f9a

# Empty entries mean we've checked and these providers don't need curation.
# Semantics are the same as if the entry was missing.

# Properties:
#   - "exclusions": ignore these resources
#   - "explicit": (boolean) if true, don't use a tracking version, only explicit versions for each resource
#   - "preview": (prefer|exclude) use the latest -preview version rather than latest stable
#   - "folders": folder(s) of the Azure spec GH repo containing this RP, purely informational
#   - "notes": misc. information for future readers
#  - "expectTracking": Either "stable" or "preview" - defaults to "stable"

# Auditing notes:
# - Compare v1-config with v2-config and look for significant changes
# - If no version listed, why?
# - Has it gone from stable to preview?
# - Does it have old additions? Could they be excluded if moved elsewhere?
# - If it was previously explicit, does it still need to be?
