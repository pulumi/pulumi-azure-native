Smaller segments provide lower archive playback latency but generate larger volume of storage transactions. Larger segments reduce the amount of storage transactions while increasing the archive playback latency. Value must be specified in ISO8601 duration format (i.e. "PT30S" equals 30 seconds) and can vary between 30 seconds to 5 minutes, in 30 seconds increments. Changing this value after the initial call to create the video resource can lead to errors when uploading content to the archive. Default value is 30 seconds.
