Use an empty RunCommandManagedIdentity object in case of system-assigned identity. Make sure the Azure storage blob exists in case of scriptUri, and managed identity has been given access to blob's container with 'Storage Blob Data Reader' role assignment with scriptUri blob and 'Storage Blob Data Contributor' for Append blobs(outputBlobUri, errorBlobUri). In case of user assigned identity, make sure you add it under VM's identity. For more info on managed identity and Run Command, refer https://aka.ms/ManagedIdentity and https://aka.ms/RunCommandManaged.
