Config automatically assigns the name of 'default' when creating the configuration recorder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;note&gt; &lt;p&gt;You cannot change the name of the configuration recorder after it has been created. To change the configuration recorder name, you must delete it and create a new configuration recorder with a new name. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/note&gt;

During the initial bootstrapping process, Config runs evaluations on all the resources in your account that you have selected for Config to record.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are running ephemeral workloads, you may see increased activity from Config as it records configuration changes associated with creating and deleting these temporary resources. An &lt;i&gt;ephemeral workload&lt;/i&gt; is a temporary use of computing resources that are loaded and run when needed. Examples include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Spot Instances, Amazon EMR jobs, and Auto Scaling. If you want to avoid the increased activity from running ephemeral workloads, you can run these types of workloads in a separate account with Config turned off to avoid increased configuration recording and rule evaluations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/note&gt;

If you are using Firewall Manager, it is recommended that you set the recording frequency to Continuous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can also override the recording frequency for specific resource types.&lt;/p&gt;

You must do this so that the other Amazon Web Services service continues to run as expected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, if Control Tower has an IAM role that allows Config to read Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) objects, make sure that the same permissions are granted within the IAM role you use when setting up Config. Otherwise, it may interfere with how Control Tower operates.
