Setting the ``BucketKeyEnabled`` element to ``true`` causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key. By default, S3 Bucket Key is not enabled.

If a PUT Object request doesn't specify any server-side encryption, this default encryption will be applied. If you don't specify a customer managed key at configuration, Amazon S3 automatically creates an AWS KMS key in your AWS account the first time that you add an object encrypted with SSE-KMS to a bucket. By default, Amazon S3 uses this KMS key for SSE-KMS.
