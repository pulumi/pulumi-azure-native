To prevent unexpected high charges, do not specify high-cardinality fields such as ``IPAddress`` or ``requestID`` as dimensions. Each different value found for a dimension is treated as a separate metric and accrues charges as a separate custom metric.  CloudWatch Logs disables a metric filter if it generates 1000 different name/value pairs for your specified dimensions within a certain amount of time. This helps to prevent accidental high charges. You can also set up a billing alarm to alert you if your charges are higher than expected. For more information, see [Creating a Billing Alarm to Monitor Your Estimated Charges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html).
