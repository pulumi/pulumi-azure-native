For more information about metric math expressions, see [Metric Math Syntax and Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax) in the *User Guide*. Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.
