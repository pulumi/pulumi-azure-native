For more information about using the ``awslogs`` log driver, see [Using the awslogs log driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_awslogs.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*. For more information about using the ``awsfirelens`` log driver, see [Custom log routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_firelens.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.  If you have a custom driver that isn't listed, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that's [available on GitHub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent) and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you would like to have included. However, we don't currently provide support for running modified copies of this software.
