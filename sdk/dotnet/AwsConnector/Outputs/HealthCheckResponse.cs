The string array must start with ``CMD`` to run the command arguments directly, or ``CMD-SHELL`` to run the command with the container's default shell.   When you use the AWS Management Console JSON panel, the CLIlong, or the APIs, enclose the list of commands in double quotes and brackets.  ``[ 'CMD-SHELL', 'curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1' ]``  You don't include the double quotes and brackets when you use the AWS Management Console.  ``CMD-SHELL, curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1``  An exit code of 0 indicates success, and non-zero exit code indicates failure.
