For the ``binpack`` placement strategy, valid values are ``CPU`` and ``MEMORY``. For the ``random`` placement strategy, this field is not used.

The ``spread`` placement strategy spreads placement across available candidates evenly based on the ``field`` parameter. The ``binpack`` strategy places tasks on available candidates that have the least available amount of the resource that's specified with the ``field`` parameter. For example, if you binpack on memory, a task is placed on the instance with the least amount of remaining memory but still enough to run the task.
