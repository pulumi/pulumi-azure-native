This determines how the contents of your repository are encrypted at rest. By default, when no encryption configuration is set or the ``AES256`` encryption type is used, Amazon ECR uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys which encrypts your data at rest using an AES-256 encryption algorithm. This does not require any action on your part. For more control over the encryption of the contents of your repository, you can use server-side encryption with KMSlong key stored in KMSlong (KMS) to encrypt your images. For more information, see [Amazon ECR encryption at rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/encryption-at-rest.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide*.
