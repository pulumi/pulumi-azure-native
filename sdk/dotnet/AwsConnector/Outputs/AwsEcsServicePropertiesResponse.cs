During that time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores health check status. This grace period can prevent the service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.

If you specify the ``role`` parameter, you must also specify a load balancer object with the ``loadBalancers`` parameter.  If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used for your service unless you specify a role here. The service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the ``awsvpc`` network mode or if the service is configured to use service discovery, an external deployment controller, multiple target groups, or Elastic Inference accelerators in which case you don't specify a role here. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.  If your specified role has a path other than ``/``, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name ``bar`` has a path of ``/foo/`` then you would specify ``/foo/bar`` as the role name.

There are two service scheduler strategies available:  +   ``REPLICA``-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the service uses the ``CODE_DEPLOY`` or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment controller types.  +   ``DAEMON``-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When you're using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.  Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the ``CODE_DEPLOY`` or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment controller types don't support the ``DAEMON`` scheduling strategy.
