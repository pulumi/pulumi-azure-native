        /// (Node.js and Python) The source code of your Lambda function. If you include your function source inline with this parameter, CFN places it in a file named ``index`` and zips it to create a [deployment package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html). This zip file cannot exceed 4MB. For the ``Handler`` property, the first part of the handler identifier must be ``index``. For example, ``index.handler``.  For JSON, you must escape quotes and special characters such as newline (``\n``) with a backslash. If you specify a function that interacts with an AWS CloudFormation custom resource, you don't have to write your own functions to send responses to the custom resource that invoked the function. AWS CloudFormation provides a response module ([cfn-response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-lambda-function-code-cfnresponsemodule.html)) that simplifies sending responses. See [Using Lambda with CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudformation.html) for details.
