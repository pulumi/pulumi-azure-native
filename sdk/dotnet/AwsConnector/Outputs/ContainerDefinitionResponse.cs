        /// The number of ``cpu`` units reserved for the container. This parameter maps to ``CpuShares`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--cpu-shares`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and the only requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task be lower than the task-level ``cpu`` value.  You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the [Amazon EC2 Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) detail page by 1,024.  Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that's the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task is guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed. Moreover, each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it. If both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units. On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see [CPU share constraint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cpu-share-constraint) in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter isn't required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:  +   *Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0:* Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares.  +   *Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0:* Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.   On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit, or a quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU that's described in the task definition. A null or zero CPU value is passed to Docker as ``0``, which Windows interprets as 1% of one CPU.

You must join the container instance to the domain before you start any tasks that use this task definition.  In both formats, replace ``MyARN`` with the ARN in SSM or Amazon S3. If you provide a ``credentialspecdomainless:MyARN``, the ``credspec`` must provide a ARN in ASMlong for a secret containing the username, password, and the domain to connect to.

        /// <summary>
        /// The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When system memory is under heavy contention, Docker attempts to keep the container memory to this soft limit. However, your container can consume more memory when it needs to, up to either the hard limit specified with the ``memory`` parameter (if applicable), or all of the available memory on the container instance, whichever comes first. This parameter maps to ``MemoryReservation`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--memory-reservation`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). If a task-level memory value is not specified, you must specify a non-zero integer for one or both of ``memory`` or ``memoryReservation`` in a container definition. If you specify both, ``memory`` must be greater than ``memoryReservation``. If you specify ``memoryReservation``, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance where the container is placed. Otherwise, the value of ``memory`` is used. For example, if your container normally uses 128 MiB of memory, but occasionally bursts to 256 MiB of memory for short periods of time, you can set a ``memoryReservation`` of 128 MiB, and a ``memory`` hard limit of 300 MiB. This configuration would allow the container to only reserve 128 MiB of memory from the remaining resources on the container instance, but also allow the container to consume more memory resources when needed. The Docker 20.10.0 or later daemon reserves a minimum of 6 MiB of memory for a container. So, don't specify less than 6 MiB of memory for your containers.  The Docker 19.03.13-ce or earlier daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB of memory for a container. So, don't specify less than 4 MiB of memory for your containers.

Port mappings on Windows use the ``NetNAT`` gateway address rather than ``localhost``. There is no loopback for port mappings on Windows, so you cannot access a container's mapped port from the host itself.

If the network mode of a task definition is set to ``none``, then you can't specify port mappings. If the network mode of a task definition is set to ``host``, then host ports must either be undefined or they must match the container port in the port mapping.  After a task reaches the ``RUNNING`` status, manual and automatic host and container port assignments are visible in the *Network Bindings* section of a container description for a selected task in the Amazon ECS console.

For example, you specify two containers in a task definition with containerA having a dependency on containerB reaching a ``COMPLETE``, ``SUCCESS``, or ``HEALTHY`` status. If a ``startTimeout`` value is specified for containerB and it doesn't reach the desired status within that time then containerA gives up and not start. This results in the task transitioning to a ``STOPPED`` state.  When the ``ECS_CONTAINER_START_TIMEOUT`` container agent configuration variable is used, it's enforced independently from this start timeout value.  For tasks using the Fargate launch type, the task or service requires the following platforms:  +  Linux platform version ``1.3.0`` or later.  +  Windows platform version ``1.0.0`` or later.   For tasks using the EC2 launch type, your container instances require at least version ``1.26.0`` of the container agent to use a container start timeout value. However, we recommend using the latest container agent version. For information about checking your agent version and updating to the latest version, see [Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
