        /// The *weight* value designates the relative percentage of the total number of tasks launched that should use the specified capacity provider. The ``weight`` value is taken into consideration after the ``base`` value, if defined, is satisfied. If no ``weight`` value is specified, the default value of ``0`` is used. When multiple capacity providers are specified within a capacity provider strategy, at least one of the capacity providers must have a weight value greater than zero and any capacity providers with a weight of ``0`` can't be used to place tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strategy that all have a weight of ``0``, any ``RunTask`` or ``CreateService`` actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail. An example scenario for using weights is defining a strategy that contains two capacity providers and both have a weight of ``1``, then when the ``base`` is satisfied, the tasks will be split evenly across the two capacity providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight of ``1`` for *capacityProviderA* and a weight of ``4`` for *capacityProviderB*, then for every one task that's run using *capacityProviderA*, four tasks would use *capacityProviderB*.
