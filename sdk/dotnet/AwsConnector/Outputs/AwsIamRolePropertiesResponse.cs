This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. Anyone who assumes the role from the CLI or API can use the ``DurationSeconds`` API parameter or the ``duration-seconds`` CLI parameter to request a longer session. The ``MaxSessionDuration`` setting determines the maximum duration that can be requested using the ``DurationSeconds`` parameter. If users don't specify a value for the ``DurationSeconds`` parameter, their security credentials are valid for one hour by default. This applies when you use the ``AssumeRole*`` API operations or the ``assume-role*`` CLI operations but does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL.

This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/). This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (``\u0021``) through the DEL character (``\u007F``), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

When you embed an inline policy in a role, the inline policy is used as part of the role's access (permissions) policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role. You can update a role's trust policy later. For more information about IAM roles, go to [Using Roles to Delegate Permissions and Federate Identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html). A role can also have an attached managed policy. For information about policies, see [Managed Policies and Inline Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the *User Guide*. For information about limits on the number of inline policies that you can embed with a role, see [Limitations on Entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/LimitationsOnEntities.html) in the *User Guide*.

For valid values, see the ``RoleName`` parameter for the [CreateRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateRole.html) action in the *User Guide*. This parameter allows (per its [regex pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-. The role name must be unique within the account. Role names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create roles named both 'Role1' and 'role1'. If you don't specify a name, CFN generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the role name. If you specify a name, you must specify the ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` value to acknowledge your template's capabilities.
