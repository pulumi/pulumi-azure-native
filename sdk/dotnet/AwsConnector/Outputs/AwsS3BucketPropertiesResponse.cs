A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of ACLs, and we recommend that you keep ACLs disabled. For more information, see [Controlling object ownership](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.  A canned access control list (ACL) that grants predefined permissions to the bucket. For more information about canned ACLs, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.  S3 buckets are created with ACLs disabled by default. Therefore, unless you explicitly set the [AWS::S3::OwnershipControls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket-ownershipcontrols.html) property to enable ACLs, your resource will fail to deploy with any value other than Private. Use cases requiring ACLs are uncommon.  The majority of access control configurations can be successfully and more easily achieved with bucket policies. For more information, see [AWS::S3::BucketPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-policy.html). For examples of common policy configurations, including S3 Server Access Logs buckets and more, see [Bucket policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

If you create the target resource and related permissions in the same template, you might have a circular dependency. For example, you might use the ``AWS::Lambda::Permission`` resource to grant the bucket permission to invoke an AWS Lambda function. However, AWS CloudFormation can't create the bucket until the bucket has permission to invoke the function (AWS CloudFormation checks whether the bucket can invoke the function). If you're using Refs to pass the bucket name, this leads to a circular dependency. To avoid this dependency, you can create all resources without specifying the notification configuration. Then, update the stack with a notification configuration. For more information on permissions, see [AWS::Lambda::Permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-permission.html) and [Granting Permissions to Publish Event Notification Messages to a Destination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html#grant-destinations-permissions-to-s3).
