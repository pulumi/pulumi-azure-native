Amazon S3 can send events to Amazon EventBridge whenever certain events happen in your bucket, see [Using EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/EventBridge.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. Unlike other destinations, delivery of events to EventBridge can be either enabled or disabled for a bucket. If enabled, all events will be sent to EventBridge and you can use EventBridge rules to route events to additional targets. For more information, see [What Is Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.html) in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*
