If no network mode is specified, the default is ``bridge``. For Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate, the ``awsvpc`` network mode is required. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Linux instances, any network mode can be used. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Windows instances, ``&lt;default&gt;`` or ``awsvpc`` can be used. If the network mode is set to ``none``, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The ``host`` and ``awsvpc`` network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the ``bridge`` mode. With the ``host`` and ``awsvpc`` network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the ``host`` network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the ``awsvpc`` network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings.   When using the ``host`` network mode, you should not run containers using the root user (UID 0). It is considered best practice to use a non-root user.  If the network mode is ``awsvpc``, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration value when you create a service or run a task with the task definition. For more information, see [Task Networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*. If the network mode is ``host``, you cannot run multiple instantiations of the same task on a single container instance when port mappings are used.
