CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1``).

        /// If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:  +  The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers.  +  The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers.   For more information, see [Security Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy) and [Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.  On the CloudFront console, this setting is called *Security Policy*.  When you're using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only``), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.) If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true``), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.

        /// In CloudFormation, this field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.  +   ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support [server name indication (SNI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication). This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI.  +   ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don't support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront.  +   ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the [Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/support/home).   If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net``, don't set a value for this field.
