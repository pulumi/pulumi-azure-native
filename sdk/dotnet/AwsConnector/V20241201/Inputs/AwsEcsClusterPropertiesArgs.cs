A capacity provider must be associated with a cluster before it can be included as part of the default capacity provider strategy of the cluster or used in a capacity provider strategy when calling the [CreateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateService.html) or [RunTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RunTask.html) actions. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must be created but not associated with another cluster. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the [CreateCapacityProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCapacityProvider.html) API operation. To use a FARGATElong capacity provider, specify either the ``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` capacity providers. The FARGATElong capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used. The [PutCapacityProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PutCapacityProvider.html) API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is created.
