The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.  +   ``https-only``: If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).   For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see [Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.  The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects' cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously.
