        /// The ``dnsName`` is the name that you use in the applications of client tasks to connect to this service. The name must be a valid DNS name but doesn't need to be fully-qualified. The name can include up to 127 characters. The name can include lowercase letters, numbers, underscores (_), hyphens (-), and periods (.). The name can't start with a hyphen. If this parameter isn't specified, the default value of ``discoveryName.namespace`` is used. If the ``discoveryName`` isn't specified, the port mapping name from the task definition is used in ``portName.namespace``. To avoid changing your applications in client Amazon ECS services, set this to the same name that the client application uses by default. For example, a few common names are ``database``, ``db``, or the lowercase name of a database, such as ``mysql`` or ``redis``. For more information, see [Service Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
