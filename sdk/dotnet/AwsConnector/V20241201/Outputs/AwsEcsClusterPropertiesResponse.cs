        /// The short name of one or more capacity providers to associate with the cluster. A capacity provider must be associated with a cluster before it can be included as part of the default capacity provider strategy of the cluster or used in a capacity provider strategy when calling the [CreateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateService.html) or [RunTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RunTask.html) actions. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must be created but not associated with another cluster. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the [CreateCapacityProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCapacityProvider.html) API operation. To use a FARGATElong capacity provider, specify either the ``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` capacity providers. The FARGATElong capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used. The [PutCapacityProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PutCapacityProvider.html) API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is created.

After you set a default Service Connect namespace, any new services with Service Connect turned on that are created in the cluster are added as client services in the namespace. This setting only applies to new services that set the ``enabled`` parameter to ``true`` in the ``ServiceConnectConfiguration``. You can set the namespace of each service individually in the ``ServiceConnectConfiguration`` to override this default parameter. Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service Connect.
