Specifying a default root object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution. Specify only the object name, for example, ``index.html``. Don't add a ``/`` before the object name.

If you specify ``false``, CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code ``NOERROR`` and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution. In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see [Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with R53AWSIntlong or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.

If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), use the fields in this type to specify the following settings:  +  Which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from: only viewers that support [server name indication (SNI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) (recommended), or all viewers including those that don't support SNI.  +  To accept HTTPS connections from only viewers that support SNI, set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only``. This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.)  +  To accept HTTPS connections from all viewers, including those that don't support SNI, set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``vip``. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.)    +  The minimum SSL/TLS protocol version that the distribution can use to communicate with viewers. To specify a minimum version, choose a value for ``MinimumProtocolVersion``.

You specify the location by setting a value in one of the following fields (not both):  +   ``ACMCertificateArn`` (In CloudFormation, this field name is ``AcmCertificateArn``. Note the different capitalization.)  +   ``IAMCertificateId`` (In CloudFormation, this field name is ``IamCertificateId``. Note the different capitalization.)     All distributions support HTTPS connections from viewers. To require viewers to use HTTPS only, or to redirect them from HTTP to HTTPS, use ``ViewerProtocolPolicy`` in the ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior``. To specify how CloudFront should use SSL/TLS to communicate with your custom origin, use ``CustomOriginConfig``.

To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a``.  WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked.
