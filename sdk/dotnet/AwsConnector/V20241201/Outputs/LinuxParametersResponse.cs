The Linux capabilities to add or remove from the default Docker configuration for a container defined in the task definition. For more information about the default capabilities and the non-default available capabilities, see [Runtime privilege and Linux capabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities) in the *Docker run reference*. For more detailed information about these Linux capabilities, see the [capabilities(7)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) Linux manual page.

If a ``maxSwap`` value of ``0`` is specified, the container will not use swap. Accepted values are ``0`` or any positive integer. If the ``maxSwap`` parameter is omitted, the container will use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A ``maxSwap`` value must be set for the ``swappiness`` parameter to be used.  If you're using tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the ``maxSwap`` parameter isn't supported.
