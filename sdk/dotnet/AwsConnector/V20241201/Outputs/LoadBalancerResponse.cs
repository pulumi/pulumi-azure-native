A target group ARN is only specified when using an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer.  For services using the ``ECS`` deployment controller, you can specify one or multiple target groups. For more information, see [Registering multiple target groups with a service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/register-multiple-targetgroups.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*. For services using the ``CODE_DEPLOY`` deployment controller, you're required to define two target groups for the load balancer. For more information, see [Blue/green deployment with CodeDeploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-bluegreen.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.  If your service's task definition uses the ``awsvpc`` network mode, you must choose ``ip`` as the target type, not ``instance``. Do this when creating your target groups because tasks that use the ``awsvpc`` network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance. This network mode is required for the Fargate launch type.
