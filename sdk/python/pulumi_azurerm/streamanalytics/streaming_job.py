    The properties that are associated with a streaming job.  Required on PUT (CreateOrReplace) requests.
      * `compatibility_level` (`str`) - Controls certain runtime behaviors of the streaming job.
      * `created_date` (`str`) - Value is an ISO-8601 formatted UTC timestamp indicating when the streaming job was created.
      * `data_locale` (`str`) - The data locale of the stream analytics job. Value should be the name of a supported .NET Culture from the set https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.culturetypes(v=vs.110).aspx. Defaults to 'en-US' if none specified.
      * `etag` (`str`) - The current entity tag for the streaming job. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the resource has changed between requests. You can also use it in the If-Match or If-None-Match headers for write operations for optimistic concurrency.
      * `events_late_arrival_max_delay_in_seconds` (`float`) - The maximum tolerable delay in seconds where events arriving late could be included.  Supported range is -1 to 1814399 (20.23:59:59 days) and -1 is used to specify wait indefinitely. If the property is absent, it is interpreted to have a value of -1.
      * `events_out_of_order_max_delay_in_seconds` (`float`) - The maximum tolerable delay in seconds where out-of-order events can be adjusted to be back in order.
      * `events_out_of_order_policy` (`str`) - Indicates the policy to apply to events that arrive out of order in the input event stream.
      * `functions` (`list`) - A list of one or more functions for the streaming job. The name property for each function is required when specifying this property in a PUT request. This property cannot be modify via a PATCH operation. You must use the PATCH API available for the individual transformation.

        * `type` (`str`) - Resource type

      * `inputs` (`list`) - A list of one or more inputs to the streaming job. The name property for each input is required when specifying this property in a PUT request. This property cannot be modify via a PATCH operation. You must use the PATCH API available for the individual input.

        * `name` (`str`) - Resource name
        * `properties` (`dict`) - The properties that are associated with an input. Required on PUT (CreateOrReplace) requests.
          * `diagnostics` (`dict`) - Describes conditions applicable to the Input, Output, or the job overall, that warrant customer attention.
            * `conditions` (`list`) - A collection of zero or more conditions applicable to the resource, or to the job overall, that warrant customer attention.

              * `since` (`str`) - The UTC timestamp of when the condition started. Customers should be able to find a corresponding event in the ops log around this time.

          * `etag` (`str`) - The current entity tag for the input. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the resource has changed between requests. You can also use it in the If-Match or If-None-Match headers for write operations for optimistic concurrency.
          * `serialization` (`dict`) - Describes how data from an input is serialized or how data is serialized when written to an output. Required on PUT (CreateOrReplace) requests.
