      * `probe_path` (`str`) - Path to a file hosted on the origin which helps accelerate delivery of the dynamic content and calculate the most optimal routes for the CDN. This is relative to the origin path. This property is only relevant when using a single origin.
      * `provisioning_state` (`str`) - Provisioning status of the endpoint.
      * `query_string_caching_behavior` (`str`) - Defines how CDN caches requests that include query strings. You can ignore any query strings when caching, bypass caching to prevent requests that contain query strings from being cached, or cache every request with a unique URL.
