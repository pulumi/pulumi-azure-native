            If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy application, the health is evaluated as Warning.
            This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy applications over the total number of application instances in the cluster, excluding applications of application types that are included in the ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap.

            The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy nodes over the total number of nodes in the cluster.
            The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of nodes. Default percentage is zero.
            
            In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.

            * `health_check_retry_timeout` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The amount of time to retry health evaluation when the application or cluster is unhealthy before the upgrade rolls back. The timeout can be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
            * `health_check_stable_duration` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The amount of time that the application or cluster must remain healthy before the upgrade proceeds to the next upgrade domain. The duration can be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
            * `health_check_wait_duration` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The length of time to wait after completing an upgrade domain before performing health checks. The duration can be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
            * `health_policy` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - The cluster health policy used when upgrading the cluster.
              * `application_health_policies` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Defines the application health policy map used to evaluate the health of an application or one of its children entities.
              * `max_percent_unhealthy_applications` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy applications before reporting an error. For example, to allow 10% of applications to be unhealthy, this value would be 10.
                
                The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of applications that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.
                If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy application, the health is evaluated as Warning.
                This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy applications over the total number of application instances in the cluster, excluding applications of application types that are included in the ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap.
                The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of applications. Default percentage is zero.
              * `max_percent_unhealthy_nodes` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes before reporting an error. For example, to allow 10% of nodes to be unhealthy, this value would be 10.
                
                The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.
                If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node, the health is evaluated as Warning.
                The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy nodes over the total number of nodes in the cluster.
                The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of nodes. Default percentage is zero.
                
                In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.

            * `upgrade_domain_timeout` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The amount of time each upgrade domain has to complete before the upgrade rolls back. The timeout can be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
            * `upgrade_replica_set_check_timeout` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The maximum amount of time to block processing of an upgrade domain and prevent loss of availability when there are unexpected issues. When this timeout expires, processing of the upgrade domain will proceed regardless of availability loss issues. The timeout is reset at the start of each upgrade domain. The timeout can be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
            * `upgrade_timeout` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The amount of time the overall upgrade has to complete before the upgrade rolls back. The timeout can be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.

          * `upgrade_mode` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The upgrade mode of the cluster when new Service Fabric runtime version is available.
            
              - Automatic - The cluster will be automatically upgraded to the latest Service Fabric runtime version as soon as it is available.
              - Manual - The cluster will not be automatically upgraded to the latest Service Fabric runtime version. The cluster is upgraded by setting the **clusterCodeVersion** property in the cluster resource.
          * `vm_image` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The VM image VMSS has been configured with. Generic names such as Windows or Linux can be used.
