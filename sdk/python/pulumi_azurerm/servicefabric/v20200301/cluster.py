          The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of applications that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.
          If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy application, the health is evaluated as Warning.
          This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy applications over the total number of application instances in the cluster, excluding applications of application types that are included in the ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap.
          The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of applications. Default percentage is zero.

          If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node, the health is evaluated as Warning.
          The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy nodes over the total number of nodes in the cluster.
          The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of nodes. Default percentage is zero.
          
          In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.

          * `is_primary` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - The node type on which system services will run. Only one node type should be marked as primary. Primary node type cannot be deleted or changed for existing clusters.
          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The name of the node type.
          * `placement_properties` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - The placement tags applied to nodes in the node type, which can be used to indicate where certain services (workload) should run.
          * `reverse_proxy_endpoint_port` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The endpoint used by reverse proxy.
          * `vm_instance_count` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of nodes in the node type. This count should match the capacity property in the corresponding VirtualMachineScaleSet resource.

        The **upgrade_description** object supports the following:

          * `delta_health_policy` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - The cluster delta health policy used when upgrading the cluster.
            * `application_delta_health_policies` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Defines the application delta health policy map used to evaluate the health of an application or one of its child entities when upgrading the cluster.
            * `max_percent_delta_unhealthy_applications` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum allowed percentage of applications health degradation allowed during cluster upgrades.
              The delta is measured between the state of the applications at the beginning of upgrade and the state of the applications at the time of the health evaluation.
              The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion to make sure the global state of the cluster is within tolerated limits. System services are not included in this.
            * `max_percent_delta_unhealthy_nodes` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum allowed percentage of nodes health degradation allowed during cluster upgrades.
              The delta is measured between the state of the nodes at the beginning of upgrade and the state of the nodes at the time of the health evaluation.
              The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion to make sure the global state of the cluster is within tolerated limits.
            * `max_percent_upgrade_domain_delta_unhealthy_nodes` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum allowed percentage of upgrade domain nodes health degradation allowed during cluster upgrades.
              The delta is measured between the state of the upgrade domain nodes at the beginning of upgrade and the state of the upgrade domain nodes at the time of the health evaluation.
              The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion for all completed upgrade domains to make sure the state of the upgrade domains is within tolerated limits.

          * `force_restart` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - If true, then processes are forcefully restarted during upgrade even when the code version has not changed (the upgrade only changes configuration or data).
          * `health_check_retry_timeout` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The amount of time to retry health evaluation when the application or cluster is unhealthy before the upgrade rolls back. The timeout can be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
          * `health_check_stable_duration` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The amount of time that the application or cluster must remain healthy before the upgrade proceeds to the next upgrade domain. The duration can be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
          * `health_check_wait_duration` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The length of time to wait after completing an upgrade domain before performing health checks. The duration can be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
          * `health_policy` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - The cluster health policy used when upgrading the cluster.
            * `application_health_policies` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Defines the application health policy map used to evaluate the health of an application or one of its children entities.
            * `max_percent_unhealthy_applications` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy applications before reporting an error. For example, to allow 10% of applications to be unhealthy, this value would be 10.
              
              The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of applications that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.
              If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy application, the health is evaluated as Warning.
              This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy applications over the total number of application instances in the cluster, excluding applications of application types that are included in the ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap.
              The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of applications. Default percentage is zero.
            * `max_percent_unhealthy_nodes` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes before reporting an error. For example, to allow 10% of nodes to be unhealthy, this value would be 10.
              
              The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.
              If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node, the health is evaluated as Warning.
              The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy nodes over the total number of nodes in the cluster.
              The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of nodes. Default percentage is zero.
              
              In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.

          * `upgrade_domain_timeout` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The amount of time each upgrade domain has to complete before the upgrade rolls back. The timeout can be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
          * `upgrade_replica_set_check_timeout` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The maximum amount of time to block processing of an upgrade domain and prevent loss of availability when there are unexpected issues. When this timeout expires, processing of the upgrade domain will proceed regardless of availability loss issues. The timeout is reset at the start of each upgrade domain. The timeout can be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
          * `upgrade_timeout` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The amount of time the overall upgrade has to complete before the upgrade rolls back. The timeout can be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.
