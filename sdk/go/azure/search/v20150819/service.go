You can set this property to enable up to 3 high density partitions that allow up to 1000 indexes, which is much higher than the maximum indexes allowed for any other SKU. For the standard3 SKU, the value is either 'default' or 'highDensity'. For all other SKUs, this value must be 'default'.
	HostingMode pulumi.StringPtrOutput `pulumi:"hostingMode"`
	// The identity of the resource.
	Identity IdentityResponsePtrOutput `pulumi:"identity"`
	// The geographic location of the resource. This must be one of the supported and registered Azure Geo Regions (for example, West US, East US, Southeast Asia, and so forth). This property is required when creating a new resource.
	Location pulumi.StringPtrOutput `pulumi:"location"`
	// The name of the resource.
	Name pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"name"`
	// The number of partitions in the Search service; if specified, it can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12. Values greater than 1 are only valid for standard SKUs. For 'standard3' services with hostingMode set to 'highDensity', the allowed values are between 1 and 3.
	PartitionCount pulumi.IntPtrOutput `pulumi:"partitionCount"`
	// The state of the last provisioning operation performed on the Search service. Provisioning is an intermediate state that occurs while service capacity is being established. After capacity is set up, provisioningState changes to either 'succeeded' or 'failed'. Client applications can poll provisioning status (the recommended polling interval is from 30 seconds to one minute) by using the Get Search Service operation to see when an operation is completed. If you are using the free service, this value tends to come back as 'succeeded' directly in the call to Create Search service. This is because the free service uses capacity that is already set up.
	ProvisioningState pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"provisioningState"`

This can occur when the underlying search units are not healthy. The Search service is most likely operational, but performance might be slow and some requests might be dropped. 'disabled': The Search service is disabled. In this state, the service will reject all API requests. 'error': The Search service is in an error state. If your service is in the degraded, disabled, or error states, it means the Azure Cognitive Search team is actively investigating the underlying issue. Dedicated services in these states are still chargeable based on the number of search units provisioned.
