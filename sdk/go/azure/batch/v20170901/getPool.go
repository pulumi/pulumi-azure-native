	//
	//  Steady - The pool is not resizing. There are no changes to the number of nodes in the pool in progress. A pool enters this state when it is created and when no operations are being performed on the pool to change the number of dedicated nodes.
	//  Resizing - The pool is resizing; that is, compute nodes are being added to or removed from the pool.
	//  Stopping - The pool was resizing, but the user has requested that the resize be stopped, but the stop request has not yet been completed.
	AllocationState               string `pulumi:"allocationState"`
	AllocationStateTransitionTime string `pulumi:"allocationStateTransitionTime"`
	// The list of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported, pool creation will fail.

	ApplicationPackages []ApplicationPackageReferenceResponse `pulumi:"applicationPackages"`
	// This property is set only if the pool automatically scales, i.e. autoScaleSettings are used.
	AutoScaleRun AutoScaleRunResponse `pulumi:"autoScaleRun"`
	// For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
	Certificates            []CertificateReferenceResponse `pulumi:"certificates"`

	// The display name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
	DisplayName *string `pulumi:"displayName"`
	// The ETag of the resource, used for concurrency statements.
	Etag string `pulumi:"etag"`
	// This imposes restrictions on which nodes can be assigned to the pool. Enabling this value can reduce the chance of the requested number of nodes to be allocated in the pool. If not specified, this value defaults to 'Disabled'.
	InterNodeCommunication *string `pulumi:"interNodeCommunication"`
	// This is the last time at which the pool level data, such as the targetDedicatedNodes or autoScaleSettings, changed. It does not factor in node-level changes such as a compute node changing state.
	LastModified    string `pulumi:"lastModified"`
	MaxTasksPerNode *int   `pulumi:"maxTasksPerNode"`
	// The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.
	Metadata []MetadataItemResponse `pulumi:"metadata"`
	// The name of the resource.
	Name string `pulumi:"name"`
	// The network configuration for a pool.
	NetworkConfiguration *NetworkConfigurationResponse `pulumi:"networkConfiguration"`
	// Values are:
	//
	//  Succeeded - The pool is available to run tasks subject to the availability of compute nodes.
	//  Deleting - The user has requested that the pool be deleted, but the delete operation has not yet completed.
	ProvisioningState               string `pulumi:"provisioningState"`

	// Describes either the current operation (if the pool AllocationState is Resizing) or the previously completed operation (if the AllocationState is Steady).
	ResizeOperationStatus ResizeOperationStatusResponse `pulumi:"resizeOperationStatus"`
	// Defines the desired size of the pool. This can either be 'fixedScale' where the requested targetDedicatedNodes is specified, or 'autoScale' which defines a formula which is periodically reevaluated. If this property is not specified, the pool will have a fixed scale with 0 targetDedicatedNodes.
	ScaleSettings *ScaleSettingsResponse `pulumi:"scaleSettings"`
	// In an PATCH (update) operation, this property can be set to an empty object to remove the start task from the pool.
	StartTask            *StartTaskResponse            `pulumi:"startTask"`
