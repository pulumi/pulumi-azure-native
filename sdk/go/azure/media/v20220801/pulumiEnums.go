// Live event type. When encodingType is set to PassthroughBasic or PassthroughStandard, the service simply passes through the incoming video and audio layer(s) to the output. When encodingType is set to Standard or Premium1080p, a live encoder transcodes the incoming stream into multiple bitrates or layers. See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095101 for more information. This property cannot be modified after the live event is created.

type StretchMode string

	StretchModeNone = StretchMode("None")
	// Override the output resolution, and change it to match the display aspect ratio of the input, without padding. For example, if the input is 1920x1080 and the encoding preset asks for 1280x1280, then the value in the preset is overridden, and the output will be at 1280x720, which maintains the input aspect ratio of 16:9.
	StretchModeAutoSize = StretchMode("AutoSize")
	// Pad the output (with either letterbox or pillar box) to honor the output resolution, while ensuring that the active video region in the output has the same aspect ratio as the input. For example, if the input is 1920x1080 and the encoding preset asks for 1280x1280, then the output will be at 1280x1280, which contains an inner rectangle of 1280x720 at aspect ratio of 16:9, and pillar box regions 280 pixels wide at the left and right.
