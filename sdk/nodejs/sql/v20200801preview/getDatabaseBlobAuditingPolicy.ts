     * Specifies the Actions-Groups and Actions to audit.
     * 
     * The recommended set of action groups to use is the following combination - this will audit all the queries and stored procedures executed against the database, as well as successful and failed logins:
     * 
     * BATCH_COMPLETED_GROUP,
     * SUCCESSFUL_DATABASE_AUTHENTICATION_GROUP,
     * FAILED_DATABASE_AUTHENTICATION_GROUP.
     * 
     * This above combination is also the set that is configured by default when enabling auditing from the Azure portal.
     * 
     * The supported action groups to audit are (note: choose only specific groups that cover your auditing needs. Using unnecessary groups could lead to very large quantities of audit records):
     * 
     * APPLICATION_ROLE_CHANGE_PASSWORD_GROUP
     * BACKUP_RESTORE_GROUP
     * DATABASE_LOGOUT_GROUP
     * DATABASE_OBJECT_CHANGE_GROUP
     * DATABASE_OBJECT_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE_GROUP
     * DATABASE_OBJECT_PERMISSION_CHANGE_GROUP
     * DATABASE_OPERATION_GROUP
     * DATABASE_PERMISSION_CHANGE_GROUP
     * DATABASE_PRINCIPAL_CHANGE_GROUP
     * DATABASE_PRINCIPAL_IMPERSONATION_GROUP
     * DATABASE_ROLE_MEMBER_CHANGE_GROUP
     * FAILED_DATABASE_AUTHENTICATION_GROUP
     * SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP
     * SCHEMA_OBJECT_CHANGE_GROUP
     * SCHEMA_OBJECT_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE_GROUP
     * SCHEMA_OBJECT_PERMISSION_CHANGE_GROUP
     * SUCCESSFUL_DATABASE_AUTHENTICATION_GROUP
     * USER_CHANGE_PASSWORD_GROUP
     * BATCH_STARTED_GROUP
     * BATCH_COMPLETED_GROUP
     * 
     * These are groups that cover all sql statements and stored procedures executed against the database, and should not be used in combination with other groups as this will result in duplicate audit logs.
     * 
     * For more information, see [Database-Level Audit Action Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-action-groups-and-actions#database-level-audit-action-groups).
     * 
     * For Database auditing policy, specific Actions can also be specified (note that Actions cannot be specified for Server auditing policy). The supported actions to audit are:
     * SELECT
     * UPDATE
     * INSERT
     * DELETE
     * EXECUTE
     * RECEIVE
     * REFERENCES
     * 
     * The general form for defining an action to be audited is:
     * {action} ON {object} BY {principal}
     * 
     * Note that <object> in the above format can refer to an object like a table, view, or stored procedure, or an entire database or schema. For the latter cases, the forms DATABASE::{db_name} and SCHEMA::{schema_name} are used, respectively.
     * 
     * For example:
     * SELECT on dbo.myTable by public
     * SELECT on DATABASE::myDatabase by public
     * SELECT on SCHEMA::mySchema by public
     * 
     * For more information, see [Database-Level Audit Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-action-groups-and-actions#database-level-audit-actions)
