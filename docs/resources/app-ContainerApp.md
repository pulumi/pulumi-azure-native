**Note**: the current default Azure API version for this resource, 2022-10-01, has an issue with referencing Key Vault secrets via the `KeyVaultUrl` property. If you encounter the error _invalid: value or keyVaultUrl and identity should be provided_ with such a configuration, you can use API version 2023-05-1 instead. In v3 of this provider, we will update the default API version.
