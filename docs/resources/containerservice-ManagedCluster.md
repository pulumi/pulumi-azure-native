When creating a managed cluster you must define at least one agent pool inline via the `agentPoolProfiles` property. The Azure API does not currently allow this property to be updated directly. Instead, additional agent pools can be defined via the `AgentPool` resource. If needing to change the initial agent pool profile property, you can either trigger the whole cluster to be re-created by using the [replaceOnChanges resource option](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/concepts/options/replaceonchanges/), or make the change directly in Azure then use `pulumi refresh` to update the stack's stack to match.
