New Azure API updates sometimes produce merge conflicts as we attempt to reconcile the types
within and between versions. If you encounter one of these errors there are a few different 
approaches to resolve them depending on the source of the conflict:

 - Excluding a version from the default version selection through exclusions in the config.
 - Modifying the merge logic to handle a new case.
 - Add an exception before calling merge to pick one type or the other.
 - Exclude an API version entirely from discovery.


## Example PR

[Fix nightly upgrade due to incompatible refs Â· pulumi-azure-native/2961](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-native/pull/2961) is an example PR for one of these fixes


## Particular case "incompatible type T for resource R: required properties do not match: only required in A/B: p1, ..."

This happens when the API spec defines a type in different places, with and without some required properties.

The standard workaround is to add an exception to `genTypeSpec` in `types.go`. There are some already to copy.
